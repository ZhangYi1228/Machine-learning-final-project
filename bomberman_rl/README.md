Setup for a project/competition amongst students to train a winning Reinforcement Learning agent for the classic game Bomberman.

There are four agents realized by us:
1. customized_agent, used for training, like an agent for Curriculum Learning
2. Yi_Zhang-Changjing_Hu_agent_old, this is the intial version of our agent, and is optimized to be Yi_Zhang-Changjing_Hu_agent.
3. Yi_Zhang-Changjing_Hu_agent, the optimized version, and we submitted this version agent in the agent and code submission.
4. Yi_Zhang-Changjing_Hu_agent_DQN, using deep Q-Network learning method, not stable, because of the very long training time, we did not choose this version.
